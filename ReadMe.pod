=head1 SYNOPSIS

    export PERL5OPT='-MDevel::PerlLog=/tmp/perl.log'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl gets run a lot. Many times by things that you didn't even know were Perl.
Even simple things that you know are Perl end up spawning lots of other Perl
processes. This can make some things hard to figure out.

For instance, when you run C<make> (after running C<perl Makefile.PL>), over
10 Perl processes are started.

This module gives you a way of logging every time a new Perl process starts,
and giving you specific information about that Perl process. You just need to
load this module using the C<PERL5OPT> environment variable.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

All the configuration options for this module are made as arguments to C<-
MDevel::PerlLog>. For example:

      export PERL5OPT="-MDevel::PerlLog=$PWD/perl.log,all"

This section documents the configuration options.

=head2 Log Path

By default, loggin will be done to STDOUT. If you pass an argument string
containing a C</> or a C<.> then that will be used as the file path. You
should take care to use an absolute file path, or else a new log will be
started relative to where the Perl starts.

=head2 Plugins

The following arguments are responsible for reporting certain information
about the Perl process:

=over

=item C<argv>

This will dump the @ARGV at the start of the process.

=item C<cwd>

This will show the cwd at the start of the process.

=item C<pid>

This will report the Perl process id (PID).

=back

=head2 Groups

Since there are so many plugins, you can specify groups:

=over

=item C<all>

C<argv>, C<cwd>, C<pid>

=back
